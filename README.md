- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevWig
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything software related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OWASP, security protocols, and the role of the red-team
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to security.
     Most of my experience is with web related projects in JavaScript, but I'd love to learn by doing with security.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at ahwig93@gmail.com
